# Astro Integration Guide

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Castr GÜRŲ SDK.
We'll cover how to get started using one of our SDK clients and how to make your first API request.
We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>

There is NO signup required to start making requests to the Castr GÜRŲ Cloud
— however, we recommend you register a Frame ID from your Cloud dashboard to access full features.
You'll find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).

</Note>


## Choose Your Client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use.
In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Castr GÜRŲ offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and Rust.
In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'JavaScript / TypeScript' }}
// Install the Castr GÜRŲ JavaScript / TypeScript SDK
npm install castrguru --save
```

```python {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Castr GÜRŲ Python SDK
pip install castrguru
```

```rust {{ title: 'Rust' }}
// Install the Castr GÜRŲ Rust SDK
cargo install castrguru
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
    <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
        <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
    </Button>
</div>


## Making Your 1st API Request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Castr GÜRŲ Cloud.
Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Profile endpoint to get a list of all your users.
In the cURL example, results are limited to ten users, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/profiles">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://castr.guru/v1/profiles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'JavaScript / TypeScript' }}
import { Frame } from 'castrguru'

const frame = await Frame(token).init()

await frame.profiles.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.profiles.list()
```

```rust {{ title: 'Rust' }}
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->profiles->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

## GraphQL

As an alternative to the traditional REST services, we highly recommend our efficient GraphQL server for your data needs.

<CodeGroup tag="WEBSOCKET" label="/graphql">

```json
{
  "hi": "there!"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
    <Button href="/conversations" variant="text" arrow="right">
        <>Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint</>
    </Button>
</div>
