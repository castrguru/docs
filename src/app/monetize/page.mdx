# Monetization

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Mistakes happen, and mostly they will be yours, not ours. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging (before contacting support).

<Note>
    Before reaching out to support with an error, please be aware that 99% of all reported errors are, in fact, user errors.
    Therefore, please carefully check your code before contacting Castr GÜRŲ support.

        Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Castr GÜRŲ API will return an error response with an error type and message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.
        Here is a list of the two error types supported by the Castr GÜRŲ API — use these to understand what you have done wrong.

        <Properties>
            <Property name="api_error">
                This means that we made an error, which is highly speculative and unlikely.
            </Property>

            <Property name="invalid_request">
                This means that you made an error, which is much more likely.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>
